# 🚀 ARC Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server: AI-Powered Development

> *Bridging AI Models with ARC's Enterprise Application Framework*

## 🌟 Overview

The **ARC Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** revolutionizes how developers interact with the ARC framework by creating a seamless bridge between powerful AI models (like Claude, GPT, and others) and ARC's robust ecosystem for building cloud-native enterprise applications.

This innovative implementation follows the Model Context Protocol specification, enabling AI assistants to directly leverage ARC's capabilities, accelerating development cycles and enhancing productivity across your organization.

## 🛠️ Tool Suite

The ARC MCP Server exposes a comprehensive set of tools that empower AI models to assist with every aspect of the application development lifecycle:

### 📚 Documentation Assistant

**Tool: `arc.docs.search`**

Transform how your team accesses and utilizes ARC documentation:

- ✅ **Contextual Knowledge**: Get precise explanations of ARC concepts tailored to your specific use case
- ✅ **Code Examples**: Receive relevant code snippets that solve your exact problem
- ✅ **Troubleshooting**: Quickly diagnose issues with documentation-backed solutions
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Learn recommended approaches directly from official guidelines

```json
// Example: AI assistant helping with authentication concepts
{
  "toolId": "arc.docs.search",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "authentication service configuration",
    "category": "api",
    "maxResults": 3
  }
}
```

### 🔐 API Microservices Integration

**Tools: `arc.api.authentication`, `arc.api.notification`, and more**

Interact directly with ARC microservices through natural language:

- ✅ **Authentication Operations**: Test login flows, verify tokens, and manage sessions
- ✅ **Notification Management**: Configure and trigger notifications across channels
- ✅ **Data Operations**: Query and manipulate data through repository services
- ✅ **Workflow Execution**: Trigger and monitor business processes

```json
// Example: AI assistant helping test authentication
{
  "toolId": "arc.api.authentication",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "verifyToken",
    "token": "your-jwt-token"
  }
}
```

### 🏗️ Project Generation & Scaffolding

**Tool: `arc.generator.microservice`**

Accelerate development with AI-powered code generation:

- ✅ **Microservice Scaffolding**: Generate complete microservice structures from descriptions
- ✅ **Model Creation**: Define data models through conversation
- ✅ **API Design**: Create controllers and endpoints based on requirements
- ✅ **Business Logic**: Implement common patterns and workflows automatically

```json
// Example: AI assistant generating a payment service
{
  "toolId": "arc.generator.microservice",
  "parameters": {
    "name": "payment-service",
    "features": ["database", "authentication", "api"],
    "models": [
      {
        "name": "Payment",
        "properties": {
          "id": "string",
          "amount": "number",
          "status": "string"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### ☁️ Deployment Assistance

**Tool: `arc.deployment.infrastructure`**

Streamline your path to production:

- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code**: Generate deployment templates for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
- ✅ **CI/CD Configuration**: Set up automated pipelines with best practices
- ✅ **Environment Setup**: Configure development, staging, and production environments
- ✅ **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose and resolve deployment issues

```json
// Example: AI assistant helping with AWS deployment
{
  "toolId": "arc.deployment.infrastructure",
  "parameters": {
    "projectPath": "./my-arc-project",
    "platform": "aws",
    "options": {
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "resources": {
        "cpu": "1",
        "memory": "2GB"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
