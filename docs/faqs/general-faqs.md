4. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.

## Usage

### How do I start using the ARC MCP with an AI model?

Once you have the ARC MCP running and connected to your AI model:

1. Start a conversation with the AI model
2. Ask questions or give instructions related to ARC
3. The AI model will use the MCP to access ARC documentation, interact with services, or generate code as needed

Example prompts:
- "Help me understand how ARC's authentication service works"
- "Generate a new microservice for handling user notifications"
- "Deploy my ARC application to AWS"

### What tools are available through the ARC MCP?

The ARC MCP provides several categories of tools:

1. **Documentation Tools**: Access and interpret ARC documentation
2. **API Tools**: Interact with ARC APIs and microservices
3. **Generator Tools**: Generate new ARC projects and components
4. **Deployment Tools**: Deploy ARC applications to various environments

For a complete list of available tools, see the [Tool Definitions Reference](../reference/tool-definitions-reference.md).

### Can I create custom tools for the ARC MCP?

Yes, you can create custom tools to extend the capabilities of the ARC MCP. This involves:

1. Defining the tool's metadata, parameters, and return type
2. Implementing the tool's functionality in a handler function
3. Registering the tool with the MCP server

For detailed instructions, see the [Custom Tool Development](../implementation/custom-tool-development.md) guide.

### How does the ARC MCP maintain context across interactions?

The ARC MCP maintains context across interactions through:

1. **Conversation History**: Storing previous messages in the conversation
2. **Tool Execution History**: Recording previous tool executions
3. **Session State**: Maintaining user-specific state information
4. **Persistence**: Optionally persisting context to disk for long-lived conversations

This allows the AI model to have context-aware conversations with users about their ARC applications.

## Security

### Is the ARC MCP secure?

The ARC MCP includes several security features:

- **API Key Authentication**: Ensures only authorized AI models can access the MCP
- **Permission Management**: Controls which tools each AI model can access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through excessive requests
- **Audit Logging**: Records all tool executions for security monitoring

However, security also depends on proper configuration and deployment. For best practices, see the [Security Best Practices](../implementation/security-best-practices.md) guide.

### How do I secure the communication between AI models and the MCP?

To secure communication between AI models and the MCP:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Configure the MCP server to use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
2. **API Key Authentication**: Implement API key authentication for all requests
3. **Network Security**: Deploy the MCP in a secure network environment
4. **Firewall Rules**: Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the MCP server

### How does the ARC MCP handle sensitive data?

The ARC MCP includes features for handling sensitive data:

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data at rest and in transit
2. **Data Masking**: Masks sensitive data in logs and error messages
3. **Access Control**: Controls access to sensitive data through permissions
4. **Data Minimization**: Only collects and stores necessary data

For more information, see the [Security Best Practices](../implementation/security-best-practices.md) guide.

## Troubleshooting

### The AI model can't connect to the MCP server. What should I check?

If the AI model can't connect to the MCP server, check:

1. **Server Status**: Ensure the MCP server is running
2. **Network Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity between the AI model and MCP server
3. **Configuration**: Check the AI model's configuration for connecting to the MCP
4. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure firewall rules allow the connection
5. **Logs**: Check the MCP server logs for error messages

### Tool execution is failing. How can I debug this?

If tool execution is failing, try these debugging steps:

1. **Check Logs**: Review the MCP server logs for error messages
2. **Verify Parameters**: Ensure the tool is being called with valid parameters
3. **Test Directly**: Test the tool directly using the API to bypass the AI model
4. **Check Permissions**: Verify that the AI model has permission to use the tool
5. **Service Status**: Check that any dependent ARC services are running

For more troubleshooting guidance, see the [Debugging Guide](../troubleshooting/debugging.md).

### How do I update the ARC MCP to the latest version?

To update the ARC MCP to the latest version:

1. If installed globally via npm:
   ```bash
   npm update -g arc-mcp-server
   ```

2. If built from source:
   ```bash
   cd arc-mcp-server
   git pull
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

After updating, restart the MCP server to apply the changes.

## Performance and Scaling

### How many concurrent users can the ARC MCP support?

The number of concurrent users the ARC MCP can support depends on:

- Hardware resources (CPU, memory)
- Network bandwidth
- Complexity of tool operations
- External service dependencies

For most deployments, a single MCP server can handle dozens of concurrent users. For larger deployments, consider load balancing across multiple MCP servers.

### How can I improve the performance of the ARC MCP?

To improve the performance of the ARC MCP:

1. **Hardware Resources**: Allocate sufficient CPU and memory
2. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for database and service connections
4. **Optimization**: Optimize tool implementations for performance
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor performance metrics to identify bottlenecks

### Can I deploy the ARC MCP in a containerized environment?

Yes, the ARC MCP can be deployed in containerized environments like Docker and Kubernetes. The project includes a Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests for easy deployment.

For container deployment instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](../reference/deployment-reference.md).

## Integration

### Can I integrate the ARC MCP with other AI models?

Yes, the ARC MCP can be integrated with any AI model that supports the Model Context Protocol. For models without native support, you can implement an adapter layer to translate between the model's API and the Model Context Protocol.

For integration guidance, see the [AI Model Integration](../implementation/ai-model-integration.md) guide.

### How does the ARC MCP integrate with existing ARC services?

The ARC MCP integrates with existing ARC services through:

1. **Service Connectors**: Standardized interfaces to ARC microservices
2. **Authentication**: Handling authentication with ARC services
3. **Data Transformation**: Translating between MCP and ARC data formats
4. **Error Handling**: Managing and translating service errors

For more details, see the [ARC Integration](../core-concepts/arc-integration.md) documentation.

### Can I use the ARC MCP with non-ARC applications?

While the ARC MCP is designed primarily for ARC applications, it can be extended to work with non-ARC applications by:

1. Creating custom tools that interact with your applications
2. Implementing service connectors for your application's APIs
3. Extending the MCP's integration layer to support your application's patterns

This requires custom development but allows you to leverage the MCP's capabilities with any application.
