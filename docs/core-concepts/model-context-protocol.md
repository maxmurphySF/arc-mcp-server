# Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification that defines how AI models can interact with external tools and services. This document explains the protocol and how it's implemented in the ARC Model Context Server.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI models to:

1. **Request information** from external systems
2. **Perform actions** in external systems
3. **Maintain context** across interactions
4. **Access tools** provided by external systems

It enables AI models like Claude and GPT to extend their capabilities beyond their training data by connecting to external services, databases, and APIs.

## Protocol Components

The Model Context Protocol consists of several key components:

### 1. Tool Definitions

Tools are the primary way AI models interact with external systems. Each tool has:

- **Name**: A unique identifier
- **Description**: Explains what the tool does and how to use it
- **Parameters**: The inputs the tool requires
- **Return Type**: The structure of the data returned by the tool

Example tool definition:

```json
{
  "name": "searchDocumentation",
  "description": "Searches the ARC documentation for the given query",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The search query"
      },
      "maxResults": {
        "type": "integer",
        "description": "Maximum number of results to return",
        "default": 5
      }
    },
    "required": ["query"]
  },
  "returnType": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "title": { "type": "string" },
        "path": { "type": "string" },
        "excerpt": { "type": "string" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Context Management

The protocol defines how context is maintained across interactions. This includes:

- **Conversation History**: Previous messages in the conversation
- **Tool Execution History**: Records of previous tool executions
- **Session State**: User-specific state information

### 3. Request/Response Format

The protocol defines the format for requests and responses between AI models and MCP servers:

#### Request Format

```json
{
  "message": "I need information about ARC's authentication service",
  "context": {
    "conversationId": "conv_123456",
    "history": [...],
    "state": {...}
  },
  "toolExecution": {
    "name": "searchDocumentation",
    "parameters": {
      "query": "authentication service",
      "maxResults": 3
    }
  }
}
```

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "result": {
    "status": "success",
    "data": [
      {
        "title": "Authentication Service Overview",
        "path": "/docs/services/authentication/overview",
        "excerpt": "The Authentication Service provides user authentication and authorization..."
      },
      {...}
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "conversationId": "conv_123456",
    "updatedState": {...}
  }
}
```

## Protocol Flow

The typical flow of the Model Context Protocol is as follows:

1. **Tool Discovery**: The AI model discovers available tools from the MCP server
2. **User Interaction**: The user asks the AI model to perform a task
3. **Tool Selection**: The AI model selects the appropriate tool based on the user's request
4. **Tool Execution**: The AI model sends a request to the MCP server to execute the tool
5. **Result Processing**: The MCP server executes the tool and returns the result
6. **Response Generation**: The AI model uses the result to generate a response to the user

## Implementation in ARC MCP

The ARC Model Context Server implements the Model Context Protocol with the following components:

### HTTP API

The MCP server exposes an HTTP API that AI models can interact with:

- `GET /tools`: Returns the list of available tools
- `POST /execute`: Executes a tool with the provided parameters
- `GET /context/:conversationId`: Retrieves the context for a conversation
- `PUT /context/:conversationId`: Updates the context for a conversation

### WebSocket API

For real-time interactions, the MCP server also provides a WebSocket API:

- `connection`: Establishes a WebSocket connection
- `message`: Sends a message to execute a tool or update context
- `result`: Receives the result of a tool execution

### Tool Registry

The MCP server maintains a registry of available tools, organized by category:

- Documentation Tools
- API Tools
- Generator Tools
- Deployment Tools

### Context Store

The MCP server includes a context store that maintains conversation state:

- In-memory store for active conversations
- Persistent store for long-term storage
- Automatic context pruning to manage memory usage

## Security Considerations

The Model Context Protocol includes several security features:

- **API Key Authentication**: Ensures only authorized AI models can access the MCP server
- **Permission Management**: Controls which tools each AI model can access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through excessive requests
- **Audit Logging**: Records all tool executions for security monitoring

## Extending the Protocol

The ARC MCP implementation allows for extending the protocol with custom tools:

1. Define a new tool in the tool registry
2. Implement the tool's functionality in the appropriate service
3. Update the tool definitions exposed to AI models

See [Custom Tool Development](../implementation/custom-tool-development.md) for more information.

## Protocol Limitations

The Model Context Protocol has some limitations to be aware of:

- **Statelessness**: The protocol is primarily stateless, requiring explicit context management
- **Synchronous Execution**: Tool execution is synchronous by default
- **Text-Based**: The protocol is designed for text-based interactions
